                        <h1>PABLO PICASSO</h1>
                        <h2>1881 - 1973</h2>
                        <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso Was a Spanish Artist.
                            One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known
                            for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,
                            the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped
                            develop and explore.
                        </p>
                        <p>Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles
                            d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of
                            the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

                        <h2>1452 - 1519</h2>
                        <p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an Italian Artist.
                            Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of art
                            and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance.Despite having
                            many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works—including numerous
                            unfinished works—he created some of the most influential paintings in Western
                            art.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is his best known work and often regarded
                            as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced
                            religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a
                            cultural icon.

                        <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Artist.
                            In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks,
                            including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life.
                            They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and
                            are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly
                            expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.

                        <p>
                            His paintings grew brighter and he turned his attention to the natural world,
                            depicting local olive groves, wheat fields and sunflowers.

                        <p>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was an Italian Artist.
                            Michelangelo achieved fame early; two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David,
                            were sculpted before the age of thirty. Although he did not consider himself a painter,
                            Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art:
